## Supporting document for Health information system and health care applications performance in the healthcare arena: a bibliometric analysis.

### The detail Research Method. 

####Phase one 
##### Search string search on Web of Science.

The first phase is the development of search string that is used on an online database namely Web of Science. The search string used was ***"Health Information Systems" OR "HIS" AND "Healthcare" OR "Health care" AND "Application" OR "Applications"***.
Results from the search was refined to fit within the selection criteria. 
**Inclusion criteria** This included; a year range of 2013 to 2022, health related categories, English-language, and type of documents was limited to article, reviews and conference proceedings. 
**Exclusion criteria** For the exclusion criteria, selected publication that were not in English-Language and did not fit the document type and context was eliminated.  

Search link used to obtain data <https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/summary/20ec5b13-be5c-48f9-9fcf-ca9fb3a673cb-4e48f31f/relevance/1>

####Phase Two 
##### Preprocessing and conversion of data. 

Downloaded data was combined and preprocess to an acceptable format for the analysis using R studio and the bibliometric. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

####Phase Three 

Initiate and conduct analysis with the code bellow. 
The bibliometrix package in R provide a graphical interface after running the code and results are obtained from the web interface of the bibliometrix package with the biblioshiny function

```{r}
install.packages("bibliometrix")

library("bibliometrix")

biblioshiny()

```
####Phase Four
Upload data and run the analysis on the web interface launched after the execution of the above code chunk.
